# Project statement

1. Write code to identify passes made within 15 seconds of a shot
2. Use logistic regression to look at how the start and end coordinates of these passes determines the probability that it will be followed by a shot within 15 seconds. Think about how to transform the variables and use non-linear
3. Now do linear regression to look at how the start and end coordinates of the pass determine the probability that the shot is a goal
4. Combine these to give probability of a goal given the start and end coordinates of a pass
5. Rank players (grouped by position) in terms of their Expected Danger per 90. Compare that ranking to number of danger passes made per 90.
